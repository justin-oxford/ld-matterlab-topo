# VARIABLE LANDSCAPE TOPOLOGY with ARDUINO

Part of the LandDesign MatterLab Competition in 2020-2021

Authors / Designers:
Rachael M. Shields, Justin E. Oxford


Iteration: 1 of 3

This iteration prototype uses a block surface suspended by Arduino motors to
create a variable topology. The prototype uses twenty-five 1.5" wooden blocks.
Primarily an engineering pathfinder, this is the simplest version of the variable
topological concept, using known materials and relatively simple code.
